# Ride-Sharing Dispatch System Debugging Exercise

## Overview

Welcome to the debugging exercise for our ride-sharing dispatch system. This project simulates a ride-sharing company's dispatch operations using two main classes: `DispatchSystem` and `Driver`.

## Exercise Story

Imagine you are part of a ride-sharing company operating in a busy city. Your system is responsible for:

- Calculating ride fares based on distance, time, and surge pricing.
- Assigning drivers to passengers while ensuring that only available drivers are considered.
- Reporting driver statuses accurately.
- Selecting the best available driver based on an efficiency score.

The code contains several intentional issues and inefficiencies. Your challenge is to review the code as a whole, press the "Run Code" button in Codility to see what is failing, and then debug the code to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. **Do not modify the provided test cases.**

## Your Task

- **Review the Code:** Read through the entire code to understand its structure and functionality.
- **Run the Code:** Use the "Run Code" button to see which tests are failing and observe the error messages.
- **Identify and Fix Issues:** Based on the feedback from the tests, determine what needs to be fixed and make the necessary corrections.
- **Optimize Where Needed:** Improve any parts of the code that seem inefficient.

Focus your attention on the following areas:
- Fare calculation
- Driver assignment
- Driver status reporting
- Best driver selection

## How to Run the Tests

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

2. **Running the Tests on Codility:**  
   Press the "Run Code" button on the Codility interface to execute the tests and see the error details.

## Expected Outcome

Once you have identified and fixed the issues, all unit tests should pass. This exercise is designed to assess your debugging skills, your understanding of object-oriented programming in Python, and your ability to optimize code performance.

Good luck, and happy debugging!
