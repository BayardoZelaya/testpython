Debugging Exercise: Ride-Sharing Dispatch System

Story:
You are part of a ride-sharing company operating in a busy city.
Your system comprises a DispatchSystem that manages a fleet of drivers and a Driver class
that represents each driverâ€™s status.

The tasks include:
  - Calculating the ride fare using distance, ride time, and surge pricing.
  - Assigning the closest driver to a passenger.
  - Reporting accurate driver statuses.
  - Determining the "best" available driver based on an efficiency score.
